# Who are the Jews?

The term **Jew** is first used in 2 Kings 25:25. At this stage in the timeline, the House of Israel has been exiled into Assyria so the term **Jew/Jews** can only refer to the [House of Judah](/terms/who-is-the-house-of-judah).

> 25 But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck down Gedaliah and put him to death along with the **Jews** and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 26 Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
