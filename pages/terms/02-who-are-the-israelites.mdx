# Who are the Israelites?

The Israelites are the children of Jacob whom God renamed Israel:

> 27 And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” 28 Then he said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.”
